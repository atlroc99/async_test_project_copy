We are able to call the http://localhost:8083/teams from our external angular App that is running on localhost:4200.
Initially, we faced CROS issue due to cros server and port number. 
We added a filter class in our spring boot application that handles Http request comming in from another local sever and port number.

The url for the angular project: https://github.com/atlroc99/http-services.git
